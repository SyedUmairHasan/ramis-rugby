Rugby football originated at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century, including association football. In 1895, Northern rugby clubs split off and formed the Northern Union. Although they initially continued to use the Rugby Union's rules, ultimately a separate game, now known as rugby league, evolved. The first rugby match in North America was played between McGill University and Harvard University. Both American football and Canadian football evolved from rugby football. History: Wikisource has original text related to this article: Laws of Football played at Rugby School (1845) Ancient Greek episkyros player on an Attic lekythos. A scrummage in a La soule game in Basse Normandie, France, 1852. Scotland First Rugby Team wearing brown[3] in 1871 for the 1st international, vs England in Edinburgh, 1871. The First England Team, 1871, in the 1st international, vs Scotland in Edinburgh. New South Wales rugby union team, ca. 1883 A form of rugby played in 1905. Art by S.T. Dadd. The Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as &quot;?p?s?????&quot; (Episkyros)[4][5] or &quot;fa????da&quot; (phaininda),[6] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c.150-c.215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.[7][8][9][10][11] The Roman politician Cicero (106–42 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[12][13] Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.
